# PLAT-233: Workspace lifecycle management

## Statement

During S1, the platform shall retain the existing workspace lifecycle APIs (create, list/search, rename, archive/restore, and owner transfer) and SPA surface for legacy organization workspaces under the current workspace service authority. In the new account hierarchy, each team or enterprise organization shall have exactly one default workspace that cannot be archived while designated as default, and the domain service shall support additional workspaces without implicit membership grants. Individual accounts shall have no workspace. Archival shall not delete ranges bound to a workspace. Personal compatibility workspaces remain legacy storage until the coordinated S8 cutover and are not defaults of individual accounts.

## Rationale

Workspace lifecycle is the core of a usable shared-infrastructure admin layer. ADR-066 replaces the per-user personal-workspace default with typed account hierarchy while preserving existing workspace IDs and archival behavior. The S1 account creation service establishes dormant structure; S8 must converge it with the lifecycle API and principal membership in one authority cutover.

## Traceability

- IMPLEMENTS → ADR `docs/adr/066-account-principal-resource-scope.md` (Account hierarchy and S8 supersession)
- DOCUMENTS → DOCUMENTATION `docs/architecture/workspace-lifecycle-preflight-1940.md` (Workspace lifecycle activation boundary)
- IMPLEMENTS → GITHUB_ISSUE `2314` (Typed defaults and account ancestry)
- IMPLEMENTS → CODE_FILE `shifter/shifter_platform/workspaces/services/_account.py` (Default workspace creation without implicit grants)
- TESTS → TEST `shifter/shifter_platform/tests/workspaces/test_account_hierarchy.py` (Idempotent defaults, additional workspaces, and no implicit membership)
- IMPLEMENTS → GITHUB_ISSUE `1940`
- IMPLEMENTS → CODE_FILE `shifter/shifter_platform/workspaces/services/_lifecycle.py` (Transactional workspace lifecycle; last-owner, personal-workspace, and default archive invariants; reversible archived_at marker)
- IMPLEMENTS → CODE_FILE `shifter/shifter_platform/workspaces/api/lifecycle_views.py` (Session-authorized DRF workspace lifecycle API under /api/v1/workspaces/)
- IMPLEMENTS → CODE_FILE `shifter/shifter_platform/workspaces/models/_workspace.py` (archived_at reversible archive marker; archival never cascades to bound ranges)
