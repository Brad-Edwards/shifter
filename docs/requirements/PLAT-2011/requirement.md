# PLAT-2011: Organization/workspace tenancy boundary above range ownership

## Statement

The platform shall provide a stable typed Account root above Organization and Workspace in the bounded workspaces domain. Individual accounts shall own resources directly without organization or workspace subdivisions; team and enterprise accounts shall have a default organization, and every organization shall have a default workspace, with additional subdivisions permitted. Organization and Workspace public and internal IDs shall be preserved where ancestry is valid. New account membership shall target a stable principal and shall never arise merely from default creation; existing organization and workspace memberships retain their durable rows until the coordinated S8 cutover. The shared scope contract and owning-domain schema shall require explicit account scope with valid optional organization/workspace ancestry for new account-scoped resources; installation scope shall be explicit rather than inferred from absent customer IDs. Existing workspace-bound rows retain their scalar scope and owner identity until S8. Owning domains shall retain scalar scope references without cross-layer model imports or ForeignKeys. Ambiguous historical personal-workspace and ownership evidence shall block the coordinated S8 cutover without deletion or guessed reassignment.

## Rationale

The earlier per-user personal organization/workspace compatibility rule in ADR-046 cannot represent an individual without invented subdivisions. ADR-066 supersedes that rule while retaining the workspaces domain boundary, validated scalar references, and durable organization/workspace IDs. S1 adds the new schema, contracts, and mapping checks; S8 is the single production activation point for new authority and final scope enforcement.
