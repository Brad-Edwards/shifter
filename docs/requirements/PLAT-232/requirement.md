# PLAT-232: Organization profile and settings surface

## Statement

During S1, the platform shall retain the existing organization read/update API and SPA settings surface for legacy organizations. The API shall use the organization's immutable UUID publicly and authorize profile edits through explicit organization-administrator membership or the audited superuser override; integer primary keys remain internal. The new account hierarchy shall place organizations only beneath team or enterprise accounts, never individual accounts, and creating a default organization shall grant no administrator role. Account/principal runtime authority remains on the legacy path until the coordinated S8 cutover.

## Rationale

Organization profile management remains useful for shared team and enterprise accounts. ADR-066 places organizations beneath a typed account and removes the earlier assumption that every individual has a personal organization. The account schema and legacy settings runtime coexist only as dormant S1 structure and unchanged legacy authority; the S8 activation must converge account ancestry and principal membership across every access path.
