# GCE range-cell containment threat model

Consolidated threat model for a compromised in-range adversary on the GCP GCE
range-cell substrate. It unifies the boundary analysis previously spread across
the #1345 and #1347 preflights and the AWS `range-isolation-model.md`, and
records the disposition of each escape and lateral-movement path. It is the
durable companion to ADR-056; it defines no new mechanism.

## Adversary model

The adversary controls a live-fire range guest: the attacker box, the AI agent
driving it, or a deliberately vulnerable target inside a range. The strongest
assumed position is root on a range VM, including root on a Docker host whose
participant workload runs in a container. The goal is to distinguish two
outcomes that are often conflated:

- **Guest-root activity.** Full control inside the provider VM boundary. This is
  expected for a live-fire range and is not, by itself, a containment failure.
- **Crossing the provider VM boundary.** Reaching another range cell, the
  management VPC or project, the metadata credential surface with useful scope,
  or provisioner-owned cloud resources. This is the boundary the range plane
  must hold.

Containment is proven by the absence of a usable management or cross-range
credential and by effective-permission tests from the strongest
participant-controlled context, not by hiding an endpoint from a root guest.

## Boundary dispositions

| Adversarial path | Control | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cell to peer cell | Per-range subnet and unique target tags; subnet-ingress allows only declared peer sources; egress internal is limited to the range's own subnet CIDRs; the shared range NAT bridges only explicitly listed subnets and never every subnet. A participant identity holds no Compute permission to retag or rewrite firewalls. | Closed. Proven against two simultaneously live ranges by the escape suite and the static plan-leak checker. |
| Cell to metadata server | Ordinary participant containers are blocked from `169.254.169.254` as defense in depth. A root guest can still reach the endpoint; the enforceable boundary is that the attached identity carries no management or cross-range capability. | Accepted with rationale. A root guest reaching the endpoint does not cross the VM boundary because the range identity is participant-bounded (ADR-056-R3). Any retained narrow, range-only capability is recorded as an explicit acceptance. |
| Cell to management VPC or project | Higher-precedence deny of the complete deployment-owned management, range, and private-service inventory sits above any allow lane; egress defaults to deny; the public-web and operator allow lanes are validated against the denied-network inventory so neither can name an internal destination. | Closed. Proven by cell to platform pod/service/node, Cloud SQL, Redis, portal, API, and peer-range denial probes. Routing or peering is not authorization. |
| Cell to provisioner resources | No provisioner credential, database credential, task payload, or cloud-management secret is placed in guest metadata, environment, argv, disks, or logs; the provisioner identity is never attached to a guest; bootstrap uses exact-object signed delivery with a per-range credential lifecycle. | Closed. The range host and range-Vertex service accounts are least-privilege and fail the IAM resource-scope checker if a project Storage or Secret role is added. |
| Cell to internet, DNS, or Google APIs | The effective egress mode is the single policy vocabulary: `none` creates no NAT and no general Google-API lane. Sanctioned public-web egress targets the public-internet complement of the denied-network inventory; the Google private-API VIP is reachable only through the Private Google Access lane when enabled. | Closed for the configured mode. DNS is a separately tested transport and is not inferred from a name-resolution failure. |
| Internet or participant to cell | The dedicated access-workload source allows only SSH 22 and RDP 3389; management ingress is SSH-only from the provisioner or management range; the shared OpenVPN pool subnet is admitted only to each OpenVPN range's target node on its declared channel ports. | Closed. Platform peering and provisioner source CIDRs are never turned into participant ingress. |
| OpenVPN participant to anything but its target | The pool server asks the portal before admitting a certificate and receives one target address and its ports; a per-client nftables allowance (forward policy drop) admits only that tuple, only that route is pushed, client-to-client is off, and input from the tunnel to the server, the metadata server, and the health port is dropped. The pool VPC firewall allows egress only to the range network on 22/3389 and to the portal and Google API VIP on 443. One session per range; revocation within one heartbeat; fail closed after 90 seconds without portal confirmation (#2480). | Closed. Verified in a two-network lab: the target is reachable on its port only; other ports, peers, the server, the tunnel gateway address, and metadata are unreachable; heartbeat revocation disconnects, and a reconnect is authorized again. |
| Compromised OpenVPN pool server | The server runs one container in its own network namespace with only NET_ADMIN, SETUID, and SETGID, a read-only root, and no-new-privileges; OpenVPN drops to `nobody`. The VM has no public address, runs only the deploy-recorded image digest, and its identity reads only its server secret and the release record, never the CA. The portal still checks owner, generation, state, and deadline on every grant. | Accepted with rationale. A compromised server can reach range targets on 22/3389 like any participant client and can disrupt sessions it terminates, but it cannot mint profiles, reach the platform, or widen another range's firewall. |

## Protocol and address-family coverage

- **IPv4.** Fully covered. Boundary CIDRs are validated as IPv4 and the
  denied-network inventory is expressed as IPv4 space, which subsumes every
  RFC1918 deployment range plus link-local metadata.
- **IPv6.** Not supported for range-cell boundaries. The firewall compiler
  rejects an IPv6 boundary CIDR rather than accept one it cannot enforce
  consistently. Range cells run on IPv4-only VPC networking; an IPv6 range plane
  is out of scope until a separate design covers it end to end.
- **TCP and UDP.** Internal same-cell allow and the default egress deny cover all
  protocols. Sanctioned lanes are protocol-scoped: management and access ingress
  are TCP (22, 3389, and the host management SSH port), public-web egress is TCP
  80 and 443, the Private Google Access lane is TCP 443, and the shared OpenVPN
  pool admits participants on UDP 1194 and reaches range targets only on TCP 22
  and 3389. Any protocol outside a
  sanctioned lane falls to the default deny.

## Verification

Each closed boundary is proven by the versioned escape report
(`shared.range_escape`) run from participant and root-capable host context, plus
static mutated-plan tests over the rendered firewall. A boundary that cannot be
observed is recorded as skipped or indeterminate rather than assumed closed, and
a narrowly retained capability is recorded as an explicit acceptance. See
`docs/ops/range-escape-validation.md` for the runbook.
