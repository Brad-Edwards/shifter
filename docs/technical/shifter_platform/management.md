# Shifter Management

Platform administration.

## Account principals introduced by ADR-066

`Principal` identifies a human or service actor independently from Django user
and provider identity records. A human principal has exactly one Django user;
a service principal has no Django user and may have a human contact. The
`ProviderBinding` table maps one exact issuer/subject pair to one principal.
The pair is immutable after creation, including through bulk SQL updates. A
provider identity collision fails rather than silently changing principal
ownership. Principal and binding changes use strict audit writes.

The `management.services` facade creates and resolves principals through its
same-domain `management.principals` implementation. The data
migration maps existing users to human principals and maps only complete,
unambiguous legacy provider tuples. S3 (#2316) introduces the
[unified credential boundary](access-credentials.md): Knox personal credentials,
native Google service admissions, and bounded human session assurance. This
source change is deployed with the coordinated S8 cutover, not as a dual-verifier
compatibility period. Isolated-account login and recovery remain supported;
retired participant magic-link authentication is not restored.
