# GCP shared-service event capacity contract

Issue #1816 establishes one immutable catalog in
`shifter/installation/capacity_profiles_gcp.py`. A profile ID encodes a version
and participant envelope. The resolver projects that one object into four
consumers:

- Terraform: access-node minimum/maximum, Cloud SQL tier/HA/disk, Redis tier and
  memory, plus the capacity identity label.
- Helm: portal and guacd minimum replicas/resources/HPAs/PDBs, the fixed
  single-replica Guacamole client, process counts, absolute tunnel ceilings,
  WebSocket keepalive, termination grace, backend timeout, and connection drain.
- Gate: concurrency, hold and latency budgets, ready guacd minimums, and
  saturation ceilings.
- Drift: an allowlisted desired-state document compared with live provider and
Kubernetes observations. Missing observations fail closed; raw cloud payloads
and secrets are not emitted. Cloud SQL disk capacity is a minimum because the
provider cannot shrink storage; drift accepts a retained larger disk after
profile scale-down but still rejects an undersized disk.

The installation setting `shared_service_capacity_profile` is the only selector.
Provider, deployment, traffic, and gate profiles remain distinct concepts. GCP
bootstrap merges the Helm projection into ordinary generated values, so normal
deployment ordering remains authoritative and event-specific overlays cannot
silently diverge.

The p30 profile provisions five portal replicas, two guacd replicas, one
Guacamole client, regional `db-custom-4-15360` Cloud SQL, 8 GiB Standard HA
Redis, and access-node autoscaling from three to eight nodes. Portal and guacd
HPAs may add headroom, but their minimum replicas are sized to carry the gate
without a scale-up race. The Guacamole client remains one replica to preserve
the token-affinity contract from issue #928.

Database connection accounting is explicit: Django retains its qualified
`CONN_MAX_AGE=0` behavior, the Guacamole/MyBatis active JDBC pool is budgeted at
its fixed ten-connection limit, and the remaining Cloud SQL budget is reserved
for failover and operations. `POSTGRESQL_ABSOLUTE_MAX_CONNECTIONS` is a
Guacamole tunnel-concurrency guard; it is not misrepresented as the JDBC pool.

The strict gate reuses the range functional smoke's Identity Platform/TOTP,
target selection, Guacamole URL parsing, and wire protocol. A successful client
must observe `ready`, acknowledge a post-ready `sync`, and keep parsing the
tunnel for the full hold. Cloud Monitoring supplies restart, CPU, Cloud SQL,
Redis, and external HTTPS load-balancer evidence; bounded `kubectl get` and
`gcloud compute backend-services get-health` reads supply effective readiness
and backend health. No missing signal is converted to zero.
