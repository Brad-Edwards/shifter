// dc-prebaked: a PRE-PROMOTED Windows Server 2022 domain controller AMI for AWS.
// Promotion runs at bake time (not first boot) so every range boots an
// already-promoted DC with no per-range ~15-20 min promotion, which would
// otherwise dominate time-to-serve (runtime DC promotion is disabled in the
// provisioner: state_helpers._should_promote_dc_at_runtime always returns false).
//
// This is the AWS counterpart to gcp/dc-prebaked.pkr.hcl. The domain and NetBIOS
// name are variables so one template bakes any domain; dev bakes the standard
// internal.shifter / INTSHIFTER DC that /shifter/ami/dc points at. A scenario
// can bake its own directory content by passing its seed as dc_content_script
// (with a profile var-file kept in the scenario); core carries no seed.
//
// Captured UN-SYSPREPPED on purpose: sysprep cannot generalize a promoted DC
// (and the existing dc.pkr.hcl feature-only image is explicitly NOT a valid
// /shifter/ami/dc for the same reason). The built-in Administrator becomes the
// domain Administrator across the promotion reboot with the same password, so
// packer's WinRM reconnect after windows-restart authenticates unchanged.
