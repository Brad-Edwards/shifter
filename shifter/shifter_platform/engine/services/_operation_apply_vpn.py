"""Bind a realized participant OpenVPN gateway to its range owner (#2030, ADR-039-R10).

Split out of ``_operation_apply_raes`` (Sonar S104). The provisioner reports an
owner-free realization on the terminal READY result (ADR-043: ownership never
rides the operation input); the owner bound here is read from the locked range
row, so a warm claim's rehomed owner is the one that receives the profile.
