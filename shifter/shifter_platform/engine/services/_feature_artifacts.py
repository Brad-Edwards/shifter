"""Single-flight acquisition of backend-owned feature artifacts (ADR-034-R11, R12).

``request_acquisition`` is called wherever an artifact is needed (pack
registration, deploy bootstrap, launch). Under a row lock it reuses a ready
artifact, joins an in-flight attempt, respects a short failure backoff, or claims
one fresh attempt. It never launches anything itself: the provisioner launcher's
``reconcile_feature_artifact_acquisitions`` creates exactly one isolated Job per
claimed attempt, reads its result, verifies the stored object independently, and
finalizes the row. Only the attempt holding the row's current ``attempt_id`` may
complete or fail it.
