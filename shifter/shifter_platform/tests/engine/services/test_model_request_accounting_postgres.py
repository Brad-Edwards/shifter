"""Real-PostgreSQL contention and crash-boundary proof for request accounting (M04).

These tests exercise concurrent reservation, shared-account first-use, duplicate
settlement and concurrency-slot exhaustion across distinct connections with real
row locks. SQLite and mocked locks are not concurrency evidence (ADR-060), so the
whole module runs only on the Postgres lane.
