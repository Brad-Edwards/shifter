"""Guacamole client topology invariants (issue #928).

Guacamole auth tokens are minted server-side and held in the serving pod's
process memory. With more than one ``guacamole-client`` replica, a token minted
on one replica is invalid when the browser's sticky session lands on a different
replica, so first-click RDP redirects to the Guacamole login. The fix is to keep
the client (token/web) tier pinned to exactly one replica and scale ``guacd``
(the per-connection protocol worker) for capacity instead.

Guacamole runs as pods from the shared Helm chart on every cloud (the legacy AWS
ECS guacamole module was retired), so the single-client invariant is enforced by
pinning ``guacamoleClient.replicas`` to 1 in every deployment values file.
