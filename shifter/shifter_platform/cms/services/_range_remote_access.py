"""Launch-time OpenVPN admission for an RAES range (#2030).

Decides whether a launch requests participant OpenVPN authority (ADR-039-R10)
and until when. The deployment must opt in (``RANGE_OPENVPN_ENABLED``) and the
admitted backend must be one whose RAES adapter realizes the gateway. The credential
window ends at the range lease ceiling. Engine then mints the capability against
the range's persisted participant access, and a scenario that does not declare
exactly one participant-access target launches without VPN.
