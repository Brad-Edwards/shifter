"""Request acquisition of every registered pack's declared feature artifacts (ADR-034-R12).

Run during deploy content bootstrap so recipe-acquired artifacts (#2463) are ready
before the first range needs them. It only claims acquisitions; the provisioner
launcher runs the isolated acquisition Jobs. A deployment without an acquisition
Job image requests nothing.
