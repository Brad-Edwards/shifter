"""Platform-owned acquisition recipes for backend-owned feature artifacts (ADR-034-R11).

A recipe is reviewed platform code that maps one known RAES feature source name
to an upstream location, an integrity check, and an extraction rule. Packs and
scenarios never supply recipes; they only declare a source name and version.
Unknown source names fail closed, and there is no generic URL fetch.
