"""Isolated Kubernetes Jobs that acquire backend-owned feature artifacts (ADR-034-R12).

One Job per claimed acquisition attempt, in its own namespace with its own
service account, admission policy and egress policy. The Job runs a pinned,
Django-free command, holds no database access, and may only write the
content-addressed delivery prefix. The provisioner launcher creates it, reads its
single result line, and deletes it once terminal.
