"""Live re-authorization for the one communication admission transaction (#2099).

Every trigger source normalizes a bounded declaration and then enters this single
admission path. Admission re-derives authority server-side and re-checks it
against the live actor / token / workspace / target events INSIDE the locked
release transaction — never trusting origin, actor, token, or scope supplied by a
request or scheduler metadata — so revoked or unauthorized principals admit
no new work (ADR-051-R12, AC3).

Token actors require the original live owner/token pair and the exact communication
scope; neither event scopes nor system authority substitute for that identity.
