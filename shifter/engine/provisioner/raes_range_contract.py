    The exception *message* must never cross this boundary. RAES failures travel

    code whose messages can carry provider response bodies, resource ids,
    storage references, signed URLs, and guest output; the result inbox is a
    durable channel readable by anyone permitted to inspect diagnostics, and an
    authenticated range author can deliberately provoke failures to populate it.
    Truncation bounds size, not confidentiality, and ``safe_log_value`` is
    injection defence, not redaction (ADR-043-R5).

    The exception *type* is a code identifier rather than runtime data, so it
    crosses to keep the channel useful for triage. Full context stays in the
    provisioner's own logs, where the raw error is re-raised to the task runner.
