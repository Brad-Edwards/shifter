"""Per-client forwarding policy with nftables, inside the server's network namespace.

Forwarding drops by default. Each authorized client gets set elements
``(tunnel address, target address, port)`` for its declared ports only, added
after OpenVPN reports the client's tunnel address and removed when it leaves.
Clients can never reach the server itself, each other, the metadata server, or
any other address. Client traffic leaves NATed to the server's address.
